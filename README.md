## Factors of Numbers

    * This program takes a positive integer and then outputs all of the factors of that number.
    ### Requirements and Installation
        * This executable file must be run on a ** Windows ** computer.
            + The user will need the following to be installed:
                - pip
                - pipenv
                - pyinstaller
                - python 3.7.3
            + There are two dependency packages used:
                - simple_math
                - colorama
    ### Usage
        * Once everything is installed, all the user must do is type in a positive integer. Then the program will output the factors of that integer. To exit the application after it has completed, press the "enter" key on your keyboard.
    ### Contributions and Authors
        * Any improvements are always welcome! Thanks to the authors of the two dependency packages I used to make the program (Arnon Yaari - Colorama) and (Noah - Simple Math).
